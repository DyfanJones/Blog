# Intro

Hi all my name is Dyfan Jones, alot of people find it difficult to pronounce my name as it is Welsh. But here is a handy tip to help you pronounce it, "D-Oven" I am going to assume you know how to say "Jones" (there is few thousands of us in the UK). Anyways I come Nort West of England and I have been Data Scientist for roughly 5 years working at "Very.co.uk". Qualification wise I have a MSc in Mathematical Science from the University of Liverpool. 

# About me

I am one of those people who has to know what the algorithm is doing under the hood. I find it difficult to just grab a pre-canned algorithm and use it without knowing the assumptions and what is it doing, thats not my style.

For coding I am big open source fan and enjoy the 2 key languages for Data Science `R` and `Python`. I really don't have a preference for one over the other instead I am in the camp of use the language that is best for the problem in hand!

# Current Projects
